Hey  Welcome.

Pretty plain start, right?  
Yeah… I don’t welcome average either 🙂

About Me

I’m Hardik 
A Python Developer | GenAI Engineer | ML Enthusiast

I like building AI systems that actually do something useful,  
not just sit in notebooks.

From GenAI & NLP  
to FastAPI backends  
to AI products with real-world use cases

If it solves a problem → I’m interested.

What I’m Building Right Now

- GenAI applications using Gemini API  
- NLP systems (emotion analysis, rewriting, understanding)  
- Backend services with FastAPI  
- Multi-agent & workflow-based AI systems  

 Featured Projects

- Interview AI – AI-powered interview coach with feedback & emotion analysis  
- Agency AI – Multi-agent system that turns rough ideas into platform-ready content  
- Mental Health GenAI – Text-based emotion scoring with AI suggestions  

(Yes, all built. No, not tutorials.)
